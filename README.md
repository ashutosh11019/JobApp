## Architecture

![Microservices Architecture](microservices_architecture.png)

- **Gateway**: API Gateway for routing and rate limiting.
- **Config Server**: Centralized configuration management.
- **Service Registry**: Eureka server for service discovery.
- **Company Service**: Manages company data and ratings.
- **Job Service**: Manages job postings and aggregates company/review data.
- **Review Service**: Manages company reviews and ratings.
- **RabbitMQ**: Message broker for asynchronous communication.
- **PostgreSQL**: Database for persistent storage.
- **Zipkin**: Distributed tracing.

## Tech Stack

- Java 17, Spring Boot 3.5.x
- Spring Cloud (Eureka, Config, Gateway, OpenFeign)
- PostgreSQL
- RabbitMQ
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Zipkin (Tracing)
- Micrometer, Actuator

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 17+
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Maven

### Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/job-board-microservices.git
cd job-board-microservices
```

### Configuration

- Configuration files are managed via the [Config Server](config-server/).
- Update database credentials in `application.yml` or via config repo as needed.

### Start Infrastructure (DB, RabbitMQ, Zipkin)

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

### Run All Microservices using Terminal

In separate terminals, start each service:

```sh
cd config-server && ./mvnw spring-boot:run
cd service-reg && ./mvnw spring-boot:run
cd gateway && ./mvnw spring-boot:run
cd companyms && ./mvnw spring-boot:run
cd jobms && ./mvnw spring-boot:run
cd reviewms && ./mvnw spring-boot:run

```
OR

### Run All Microservices Using IntelliJ IDEA

1. Open the project root folder in IntelliJ IDEA.
2. In the Project view, locate each microservice module (e.g., `config-server`, `service-reg`, `gateway`, `companyms`, `jobms`, `reviewms`).
3. For each service:
    - Right-click the main class inside the `src/main/java` directory.
    - Select **Run main class**.
4. Repeat for all services so each runs in its own tab or window.

> **Tip:** You can also create a [Run Configuration](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/run-debug-configuration.html) for each service for easier startup in the future.
